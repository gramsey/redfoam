# redfoam
RedFoam is a high performance, highly scaleable commit log message platform (similar to Kafka)

The aim is to provide a kakfka-like or better performance and scalability characteristics, and simplify the configuration process and internal architecture (e.g. not require separate leader election software like zookeeper). It also intends to provide certain features built-in - such as support for web sockets.
